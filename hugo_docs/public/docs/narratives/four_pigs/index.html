    <h3 id="the-four-little-pigs-and-the-big-bad-user">The Four Little Pigs and the Big Bad User
</h3><p>Once upon a time, in the chaotic digital forest of a Go server, a Mother <code>main()</code> function, tired of her children hogging memory, kicked her four little processes out into the world. &ldquo;Go seek your fortunes,&rdquo; she grunted, &ldquo;but beware the Big Bad User and his <code>/chat/cancel</code> endpoint. He is a fickle, impatient fucker. Build your state management strong, or he will tear your fucking threads apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, the four little pigsâ€”four identical requests for the <code>question=&quot;nice&quot;</code>â€”scampered off down the execution path, each a pathetic little cunt with its own unique Request ID.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-little-pig-little_prestream-the-retarded-optimist">The First Little Pig: <code>little_prestream</code> (The Retarded Optimist)
</h4><p>The first pig, <code>req_5f06ba7b1c</code>, was a true dumbass. He was <code>TestStreamPreCancellation</code>. He believed in shortcuts. &ldquo;Why bother with all that hard work of establishing a stream?&rdquo; he squealed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just declare my existence and wait!&rdquo; He built his &ldquo;house&rdquo; out of nothing but a single entry in the <code>activeRequests</code> mapâ€”a flimsy shelter of queued promises and wishful thinking. He hadn&rsquo;t even tried to connect to the stream handler yet.</p>
<p>The Big Bad User, running his test script, saw this pathetic, idle process (<code>state=queued</code>) and smirked. He didn&rsquo;t need to huff or puff. He didn&rsquo;t even need a full breath. He simply sent a single, sharp POST request to <code>/chat/cancel/req_5f06ba7b1c</code>.</p>
<p>The result was not a collapse; it was an annihilation. The <code>CancelStream</code> function found the pig in its pre-broadcast state. There was no complex broadcast to unwind, no followers to consider. It was a lone, stupid pig. The system executed the <code>!broadcastExists</code> logic. A <code>types.ErrRequestCancelled</code> signal was shot into the pig&rsquo;s <code>streamHolder.Err</code> channel like a poison dart. The underlying context, if it even existed yet, was terminated.</p>
<p>The User, connecting to the stream <em>after</em> cancelling, wasn&rsquo;t met with a struggle. He was handed a pre-canned eulogy: a single JSON event <code>{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;info&quot;, &quot;payload&quot;:{&quot;completion_status&quot;:&quot;cancelled&quot;}}</code>. <code>little_prestream</code> was &ldquo;eaten&rdquo; alive, his data structures zeroed out, his memory garbage collected, his entire existence reduced to a single log line: <code>Request state purged.</code> He was a fart in the wind, a cautionary tale for idiots.</p>
<h4 id="the-second-little-pig-little_midstream-the-impatient-follower">The Second Little Pig: <code>little_midstream</code> (The Impatient Follower)
</h4><p>The second pig, <code>req_e4084e50fe</code>, was <code>TestStreamMidCancellation</code>. He was a follower, a lazy bastard who saw another pig doing the hard work and decided to leech off it. He saw that a leader, <code>req_3ed0489300</code>, was already building a magnificent brick fortress. <code>little_midstream</code> didn&rsquo;t build his own house; he just subscribed to the leader&rsquo;s broadcast, becoming a <code>FOLLOWER</code>. He found a comfy spot inside the fortress and waited for the stream of delicious tokens to start flowing from the chimney.</p>
<p>The stream began. The first few tokens of the storyâ€”&ldquo;Once upon a time&hellip;&quot;â€”flowed into his channel. He oinked with glee. But the Big Bad User was watching. The moment the <code>streamStarted</code> channel closed in the test, signaling the pig had received its first taste of data, the User struck. <code>/chat/cancel/req_e4084e50fe</code> was dispatched.</p>
<p>This was a different kind of kill. This was a follower cancellation. The system saw <code>little_midstream</code> was just a subscriber. It didn&rsquo;t terminate the whole broadcastâ€”that would be inefficient and fuck over the other pigs. Instead, it performed a precise, surgical strike. It called <code>info.broadcaster.Unsubscribe(clientChan)</code>. The pig&rsquo;s connection to the main stream was severed. His personal <code>clientChan</code> was then sent a final, fake &ldquo;you were cancelled&rdquo; event before being closed for good.</p>
<p>The pig felt a sudden, violent yank. The flow of tokens stopped. He was kicked out of the brick house, his process terminated. He was eaten mid-sentence, his final squeal replaced by the <code>cancelled</code> status. The leader pig inside the fortress didn&rsquo;t even notice. The broadcast continued for the others. <code>little_midstream</code>, the greedy little shit, learned that even in a fortress, you are <strong>never</strong> save. His state was purged, another meal for the janitor process.</p>
<h4 id="the-third-little-pig-little_poststream-the-hardworking-piglet">The Third Little Pig: <code>little_poststream</code> (The Hardworking Piglet)
</h4><p>The third pig, <code>req_3ed0489300</code>, was <code>TestStreamPostCancellation</code>. This pig was the LEADER. The <code>singleflight.Group</code> had chosen him. He was the one who did all the work. He didn&rsquo;t use straw or sticks. He built a fucking fortress of brick, mortar, and concurrency-safe maps. His foundation was the <code>singleflight.Do</code>, his blueprints the <code>broadcastInfo</code> struct. He dug the trenches of <code>doExpensivePreparation</code>, calling out to the LLM and RAG systems. He built the walls with <code>initiateAndManageBroadcast</code>, a goroutine dedicated to fanning out the stream.</p>
<p>His work attracted followers, like the pathetic <code>little_midstream</code> and the lucky <code>little_happy</code>. The arrival of the first follower triggered the <code>immortalizeSignal</code>. A switch was flipped. The leader&rsquo;s <code>broadcastCtx</code> was upgraded from a cancellable <code>context.WithCancel</code> to an unstoppable <code>context.Background()</code>. His work was now deemed too important to fail just because one client fucked off. He was now building for the collective.</p>
<p>He finished his job. The full story was generated and streamed out the chimney. He sent the final <code>completion_status: &quot;completed&quot;</code> signal. His goroutine finished, the broadcaster was closed, and <code>cleanupRequest</code> was called. His state was purged, not because of an error, but because his purpose was fulfilled. He ascended to the great ArangoDB in the sky, his <code>LogData</code> saved for eternity.</p>
<p>It was only <em>then</em>, after the pig was gone and the house was just a historical record, that the Big Bad User tried to attack. He sent <code>/chat/cancel/req_3ed0489300</code>. But he was met with a <code>404 Not Found</code>. The system responded, &ldquo;Attempted to cancel a request that was not found, you stupid fuck.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t kill what&rsquo;s already dead and archived. <code>little_poststream</code> had won by finishing his job properly.</p>
<h4 id="the-fourth-little-pig-little_happy-the-lucky-cunt">The Fourth Little Pig: <code>little_happy</code> (The Lucky Cunt)
</h4><p>The fourth pig, <code>req_482faa3018</code>, was <code>TestStreamHappyPath</code>. Like <code>little_midstream</code>, he was a follower. He saw the brick fortress being built by the leader and latched on. He subscribed to the broadcast and did absolutely nothing else.</p>
<p>He watched, terrified as <code>little_midstream</code> got eaten alive, flesh by flesh for being the target of a cancellation test. But he fought his fear like a motherfucker. The stream kept coming. He received the entire story, from start to finish, without lifting a single trotter to do any real work. He kept waiting fearfully in silence, peed his little pants a bit, but he enjoyed the fruits of the leader&rsquo;s labor. When the stream finished with a <code>completed</code> status, he disconnected <strong>happily</strong>, his test passed.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Moral of this Cautionary Tale:</strong></p>
<p>Our <code>StreamBroadcaster</code> and <code>singleflight</code> group create a system of leaders and followers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lone, vulnerable requests</strong> (<code>little_prestream</code>) are easily terminated. Cancellation logic for them is simple: kill the process, send a canned response.</li>
<li><strong>Followers</strong> (<code>little_midstream</code>) can be surgically removed from a broadcast without affecting the leader or other followers. This is the &ldquo;deceptive cancellation&rdquo; where the User <em>thinks</em> they stopped the whole thing, but they only stopped it for themselves.</li>
<li><strong>The Leader</strong> (<code>little_poststream</code>) does all the expensive work once. If it attracts followers, its context becomes <strong>immortal</strong>, ensuring the work completes for the benefit of all subscribers, even if the original leader client disconnects.</li>
<li><strong>Cancellation is state-dependent.</strong> Trying to cancel a completed request is pointless and results in a <code>404</code>, which is the correct, robust behavior.</li>
<li><strong>The Happy Path</strong> (<code>little_happy</code>) demonstrates the ultimate efficiency: multiple identical, simultaneous requests are deduplicated into one operation, saving immense computational resources.</li>
</ul>
