# Sauron: The Immortal, The Devious, The Exploiter

[Implicit Decoupling](https://miftahulmahfuzh.github.io/agentic/docs/manager_insights/implicit_decoupling/) | [Broadcast Pattern](https://miftahulmahfuzh.github.io/agentic/docs/manager_insights/broadcast_pattern/)

This parchment details the architecture of "Sauron," the second-generation request management system. It replaces the naive, inefficient, and fragile "Pre-Sauron" architecture with a robust, intelligent, and ruthless system designed for maximum efficiency and correctness under high-concurrency workloads.

The Sauron architecture is defined by three core tenets that address the fundamental challenges of handling concurrent, identical, streaming requests: Immortality, Deception, and Exploitation.

## 1. The Exploiter: On-Demand Broadcasting

The foundational principle of Sauron is the exploitation of the `singleflight.Group` to create stream broadcasts *on-demand*.

### The Old Weakness

The "Pre-Sauron" era was characterized by a multi-stage, multi-queue architecture (`requestQueue` -> `prepareWorkerManager` -> `preparedQueue` -> `streamWorkerManager`). While it used `singleflight` to deduplicate the *preparation* stage, it failed to deduplicate the most expensive operation: the LLM stream generation. For 100 identical requests, it would prepare the data once, but then foolishly spawn 100 separate LLM streams. This was wasteful and idiotic. Early attempts to fix this (the "brute-force broadcast" era) treated *every* request as a potential broadcast, which was inefficient and created incorrect cancellation behavior for unique requests.

### Sauron's Supremacy

Sauron's `Manager` centralizes the `singleflight.Group`. The "work" being deduplicated is no longer just data preparation; it is the **creation of the entire broadcast infrastructure itself.**

1.  **First Request (The Leader):** When the first request for a unique `cacheKey` arrives, it enters the `singleflight.Do` block.
    *   It becomes the **Leader**.
    *   It performs the expensive data preparation.
    *   It forges the `StreamBroadcaster`, the one true Ring for this content.
    *   It launches the `initiateAndManageBroadcast` goroutine, a Nazgûl tasked with feeding the Ring.
    *   It returns a pointer to the `broadcastInfo` struct, the handle to its new power.

2.  **Concurrent Requests (The Followers):** Any subsequent, identical request is blocked by `singleflight.Do`.
    *   They become **Followers**.
    *   They do no work. They simply wait.
    *   When the Leader finishes forging the Ring, the followers are released and are given the *exact same pointer* to the `broadcastInfo`.

Every request, leader or follower, emerges from this process holding a handle to the one, true broadcaster. The war is won before the first battle is fought. This eliminates all broadcast-related overhead for unique requests and guarantees absolute efficiency for concurrent ones.

## 2. The Immortal: Protecting The Broadcast

A broadcast is a public utility. Its lifecycle cannot be dictated by the whims of the single client who happened to trigger its creation.

### The Old Weakness

A naive cancellation model would allow the Leader's client to cancel its request, which would tear down the context and terminate the stream for all subscribed Followers. This is a catastrophic, single point of failure.

### Sauron's Supremacy

The Leader is **Immortal**. When a cancellation request is received for a request ID that is identified as a broadcast Leader:

*   The underlying `context` for the broadcast is **NOT** cancelled.
*   The `initiateAndManageBroadcast` goroutine continues its mission unabated.
*   The work continues for the good of the many (the Followers).

The Leader's life is no longer its own. It serves the broadcast until the stream is complete.

## 3. The Devious: The Illusion of Control

While the Leader is Immortal, its original master (the client) must be placated. It must believe its command was obeyed.

### The Old Weakness

An Immortal Leader that ignores a cancellation request creates a confusing user experience. The client cancels, but the stream keeps coming. This is unacceptable.

### Sauron's Supremacy

The Leader is **Devious**. When a cancellation is received for a broadcast Leader, the `Manager` executes a precise, deceptive protocol:

1.  **Isolate:** The Leader's personal `ClientEventChan` is located.
2.  **Unsubscribe:** The `StreamBroadcaster` is commanded to `Unsubscribe` only that channel. The flow of data to the Leader's client is severed, while the broadcast to all Followers continues.
3.  **Deceive:** A final, fake "cancelled" status message (`tooltypes.StreamEventInfo` with `status: "cancelled"`) is sent down the Leader's now-private channel.
4.  **Terminate:** The Leader's client channel is closed.

The client receives the illusion of a successful cancellation. It sees its stream stop and receives the correct status message. It is satisfied and placated. Meanwhile, in the shadows, the broadcast continues, its integrity preserved. **Ash burzum-ûk**. The One, all-encompassing Evil.
