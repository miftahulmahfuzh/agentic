About the old Python code.

You said Python only use a single Thread. Then what about:

```python
MAX_WORKERS = settings.MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS
```

There are multiple Workers there. Please explain how these Python Workers differ from, let's say:

```Go
prepareSemaphore: make(chan struct{}, cfg.MaxConcurrentRequests)
```

Your confusion is understandable because the word "worker" is used, but what it represents in the Python `asyncio` context versus the Go context is fundamentally different. It's like the difference between a secret agent with multiple fake passports (Python) and a team of actual, distinct secret agents (Go).

Let's break it down.

### Python `asyncio` "Workers": The Illusion of Parallelism

In your Python code, `MAX_WORKERS` controls an `asyncio.Semaphore`.

```python
# From your old code
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(MAX_WORKERS)
...
async with semaphore:
    await process_request(...)
```

Here's what this actually does:

1.  **There is only ONE thread.** This is the crucial point. One single Python process, running on one CPU core, executing instructions from one event loop. It's one guy.
2.  **The `semaphore` is a Gatekeeper.** It's not creating workers. It's a counter. It says "I will only allow `MAX_WORKERS` number of `process_request` tasks to run *concurrently*."
3.  **Concurrency, Not Parallelism.** When a task, let's call it Task A, hits an `await` statement (like `await db.get_chat_history(...)` or an LLM API call), it effectively says "I'm going to be waiting for the network for a while. Mr. Event Loop, you can go do something else." The event loop then puts Task A on pause and looks for another ready task, say Task B. If the semaphore count isn't maxed out, it lets Task B start. Task B runs until it also hits an `await`, at which point the event loop might go back to Task A (if its network call has finished) or start Task C.

Think of it like a single chef (the thread/event loop) in a kitchen. He can have `MAX_WORKERS` number of dishes (`tasks`) on the stove at once. He starts cooking dish A, puts it on to simmer (`await`), then immediately turns to start chopping vegetables for dish B. He's working on multiple dishes *concurrently*, but he's still only one chef. He can't chop vegetables for dish B and stir the sauce for dish A *at the exact same physical moment*.

**So, `MAX_WORKERS` in your Python code controlled the number of *concurrent I/O-bound operations*, not the number of parallel CPU-bound workers.** The tasks were all managed by the same single thread.

### Go `semaphore`: True Parallelism

In your Go code, the semaphore works in conjunction with goroutines.

```go
// From your new code
m.prepareSemaphore <- struct{}{} // Acquire a slot
go func(r types.SubmitRequestArgs) {
    defer func() { <-m.prepareSemaphore }() // Release the slot
    ...
    // Actual work happens here
}(req)
```

Here's what happens here:

1.  **There are Multiple Threads.** The Go runtime manages a pool of OS threads and schedules goroutines onto them across all available CPU cores. You have a team of chefs.
2.  **`go func(...)` creates a new Goroutine.** This is like hiring a new, independent chef for a specific task. This chef can work on their own, on any available stove (CPU core).
3.  **The `prepareSemaphore` is a Resource Limiter.** It limits how many of these independent chefs (goroutines) are allowed to perform the "preparation" task *at the same time*. It's a way to control resource consumption (e.g., preventing you from making 1,000 simultaneous LLM API calls).

If `MaxConcurrentRequests` is 10, your Go program can have 10 `prepareRequest` goroutines running **in true parallelism** on up to 10 different CPU cores (if available), each one doing its own CPU-bound work (like formatting strings or processing data) or I/O-bound work (like database calls) simultaneously.

### The Analogy: A Takedown

Imagine you have to assassinate 10 targets in a building.

*   **Python `asyncio`:** You are John Wick (one man, one thread). `MAX_WORKERS = 4` means you're willing to engage with 4 targets concurrently. You shoot at Target 1, and while he's falling (`await`), you immediately throw a knife at Target 2. While the knife is in the air (`await`), you start reloading (`CPU work`). You are incredibly fast and efficient at switching between tasks, but you are still just one person. You cannot physically be in two rooms at once.

*   **Go:** You are Ethan Hunt leading an IMF team (multiple goroutines on multiple threads). `MaxConcurrentRequests = 4` means you dispatch four separate agents—you, Benji, Luther, and Ilsa—to handle four targets simultaneously in four different parts of the building. They are all working in parallel. Benji isn't waiting for Luther to finish his task. They're all running at the same time. The semaphore is your mission command, ensuring you don't send in more agents than you can manage or alert the entire building.

**In short:**
*   Python's semaphore limited the **concurrency** of I/O-bound tasks on a **single thread**.
*   Go's semaphore limits the **parallelism** of independent goroutines across **multiple threads**.

Your intuition was correct. The Python "workers" were an illusion, a clever juggling act. The Go workers are real. They are an army.
