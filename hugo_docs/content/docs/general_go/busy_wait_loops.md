# What Are Busy-Wait Loops and Why Are They Terrible?

Yes, the polling system from your old `manager.go` is a classic example of a busy-wait loop, or more accurately, a "busy-wait with naps." The statement in the README is entirely correct.

### What is a Busy-Wait Loop?

A busy-wait loop, or "spinning," is a technique where a process repeatedly checks a condition in a tight loop. In its purest, most toxic form, it looks like this:

```go
// DO NOT EVER DO THIS
while (door_is_closed) {
    // do nothing but loop
}
```

A process running this code will consume 100% of a CPU core, doing absolutely nothing useful. It's the software equivalent of flooring the accelerator of a car that's in neutral. You're burning fuel, making a lot of noise, and going nowhere. The CPU is "busy" while it "waits."

The harm is obvious:
1.  **Wasted CPU Cycles:** You are paying for computation that achieves nothing.
2.  **Resource Starvation:** Other processes or goroutines that need the CPU can't get it.
3.  **Increased Power Consumption & Heat:** It's physically inefficient.

### Your Old Code: A More Civilized, But Still Flawed, Busy-Wait

Your old code wasn't as barbaric as a raw `while(true){}` loop, but it followed the same flawed principle.

```go
// old manager.go's GetRequestResultStream
ticker := time.NewTicker(100 * time.Millisecond)
for {
    // ... check condition ...
    select {
    case <-ticker.C:
        continue // Loop again after a short nap
    // ...
    }
}
```

This is a "busy-wait with naps." Instead of spinning constantly, it spins, takes a 100ms nap, and then spins again. It's like a security guard told to watch a door. Instead of waiting for an alarm (an event), he walks to the door, checks the handle, walks back, sits down for a minute, and then repeats the process all night. It's pointless, repetitive work.

Each time the `ticker` fires, the Go runtime has to:
1.  Wake the goroutine.
2.  Schedule it to run on a CPU.
3.  The goroutine runs, acquires a lock, checks a map, releases the lock.
4.  The goroutine goes back to sleep.

For a request that takes 5 seconds to prepare, this pointless ritual happens 50 times. It's death by a thousand cuts.

### Channels: The Antidote to Busy-Waiting

The reason the new event-driven architecture is so much better is that it leverages the Go runtime's scheduler. When a goroutine blocks on a channel read (`<-myChan`), it's not busy-waiting. The scheduler performs a "context switch":

1.  The goroutine's state is saved.
2.  It is removed from the list of runnable goroutines.
3.  Another, different goroutine is scheduled to run on that CPU core.

The waiting goroutine now consumes **zero CPU resources**. It is effectively frozen in time until another goroutine sends data to that specific channel (`myChan <- data`). When that send event occurs, the scheduler is notified, and it moves the waiting goroutine *back* into the runnable queue.

This is the fundamental difference:

*   **Busy-Wait:** You use the CPU to check for an event.
*   **Channel Wait:** You tell the scheduler "wake me up when this event happens," and the CPU goes off to do other useful work.

Your README is correct. The new design eliminates the busy-wait loop entirely, replacing it with an efficient, blocking channel read that frees up the CPU and makes the system vastly more scalable.
